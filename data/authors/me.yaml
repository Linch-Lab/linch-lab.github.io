bio: "I am a **Postdoctoral Fellow at Academia Sinica**, where my research investigates the fundamental mechanisms and systemic optimization of **Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFC)** and **Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzers (AEMWE)**. Bridging the disciplines of Materials Physics and Mechanical Engineering, I specialize in the synthesis of high-performance electrochemical components through precision fabrication and advanced thin-film deposition techniques. <br> In my concurrent role as **Special Assistant** to the Director of the **Hydrogen Energy Research Center at NCU**, I facilitate strategic industry-academia collaborations and coordinate research initiatives aimed at accelerating the global transition toward a sustainable hydrogen economy."
