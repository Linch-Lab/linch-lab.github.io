      title: 📚 My Research
      subtitle: ""
      text: |-
        My research investigates the core mechanisms of **Green Hydrogen** production and conversion. Key areas include: <ul>
        <li><strong>Advancement of MEA Architecture</strong>: Engineering high-efficiency Membrane Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) to enhance power density and electrochemical durability in fuel cell and electrolyzer systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrocatalyst Synthesis</strong>: Developing non-precious metal catalyst structures and functional interfaces to reduce material costs while maintaining superior catalytic activity.</li>
        <li><strong>Systemic Optimization</strong>: Analyzing mass transport phenomena and electrode morphology to ensure robust performance across diverse operational parameters.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Surface Engineering</strong>: Utilizing high-precision manufacturing technologies for the micro-structuring of electrode surfaces and functional substrates.</li>
        <li><strong>Atomic-Level Deposition</strong>: Proficient in Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) and CVD for the controlled synthesis of complex functional energy materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Diagnostics</strong>: Specialized in the characterization of material properties using SEM, TEM, and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS).</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Analytical Pipelines</strong>: Leveraging Python to develop custom algorithms that streamline the processing and visualization of complex electrochemical datasets, minimizing manual intervention.</li>
        <li><strong>Instrumentation Control</strong>: Integrating LabVIEW for real-time, synchronized data acquisition and precise control of experimental hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Laboratory Digitalization</strong>: Designing automated platforms, such as 2D-CNC systems, to achieve high-precision repeatability in material fabrication and testing protocols.</li>
        </ul>
