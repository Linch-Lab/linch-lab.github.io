Abstract = {This study addresses the critical need to enhance the performance of
   protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) by engineering a porous interlayer
   between the cathode and electrolyte. A porous interlayer composed of the
   electrolyte material, barium cerium zirconium yttrium oxide electrolyte
   (BaCe0.6Zr0.2Y0.2O3-delta, BCZY) was prepared at various calcination
   temperatures to optimize its microstructure. With the optimized
   calcination temperature of 1350 degrees C, the porous interlayer forms
   effective contact with the lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite cathode
   (La0.8Sr0.2Co0.8Fe0.2O3-delta, LSCF), enhancing the number of
   triple-phase boundary reaction sites for oxygen reduction. A PCFC with
   an optimal porous interlayer achieved a peak power density of 517 mW/cm2
   at 800 degrees C, representing an 11.6 \% improvement over the fuel cell
   without the porous interlayer. This enhancement is attributed to the
   extension of electrochemically active areas, which reduces polarization
   resistance by 23.8 \%.},
