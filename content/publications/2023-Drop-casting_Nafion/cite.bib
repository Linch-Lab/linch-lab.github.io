Abstract = {A simple drop-cast method to directly deposit Nafion polymer electrolyte
   membrane (PEM) on nanostructured thin-film catalyst layer composed of
   stacked Pt nanoparticles prepared by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) was
   demonstrated. Through optimization of solvent composition and drying
   temperature of Nafion solution to control self-organization of Nafion, a
   uniform PEM with better bulk and interface microstructures could be
   produced, leading to a significant improvement in the output current
   density of a PEM fuel cell over that using reference commercial PEMs.
   The formation of facile proton conduction pathways in the bulk Nafion
   membrane resulted in a 35\% reduction in ohmic resistance compared to
   that with the commercial membrane. Moreover, the infiltration of Nafion
   in the catalyst layer formed suitable proton transport network to render
   more catalyst nanoparticles effective and thus lower charge-transfer
   resistance. With the optimized PLD, drop-cast, and hot-pressing
   conditions, the current density of PEMFCs using drop-casted PEM reached
   1902 mA cm-2 at 0.6 V at 2 atm H2 and O2 pressures with a cathode Pt
   loading of 100 mg cm-2, corresponding to a power density of 1.14 W cm-2
   and a cathode mass-specific power density of 11.4 kW g-1.\& COPY; 2022
