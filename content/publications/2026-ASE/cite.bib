Abstract = {The rising global demand for energy and the climate crisis caused by
   fossil fuel combustion require an immediate shift toward renewable
   energy sources. Seawater electrolysis offers a sustainable method for
   producing green hydrogen by utilizing abundant ocean resources in direct
   conjunction with renewable power inputs. Green hydrogen has surfaced as
   a key energy carrier with minimal intermittent losses in transport and
   power generation. Nevertheless, the ionic composition of seawater
   affects efficiency, electrocatalyst stability, and operational costs.
   Specifically, the chloride oxidation reaction occurring at the anode
   presents a serious risk to the integrity of electrodes and the long-term
   functionality of devices. This review encapsulates the essential
   mechanisms of seawater electrolysis, the criteria for assessing
   electrocatalyst performance in renewable energy systems, and the unique
   challenges associated with noble-metal-based electrodes. Recent progress
   in noble-metal-free composite electrocatalysts through techniques such
   as heterostructure engineering, metal doping, protective coatings, and
   anion intercalation, all of which collectively increase resistance to
   chloro-oxidation and increase durability, has also been emphasized. By
   bringing together these advancements, this review offers a technological
   framework for incorporating seawater electrolysis into renewable energy
   infrastructure, facilitating efficient hydrogen production in
   challenging marine environments, ensuring reliable energy storage, and
   furthering the global effort toward a carbon-neutral future.},
