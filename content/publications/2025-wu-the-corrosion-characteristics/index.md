abstract: "This study investigates the effectiveness of graphite coatings on nickel foam for use in high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT-PEMFCs). Nickel foam, known for its high porosity and good conductivity, serves as an advantageous alternative to traditional flow channels but faces corrosion challenges in HT-PEMFCs, especially from phosphoric acid leakage. Graphite coatings are used as the protection layer and compared with nitride coatings. Chemical vapor deposition process parameters are first optimized for graphite growth. Corrosion polarization curves are then measured using a high-temperature phosphoric acid three-electrode system simulating HT-PEMFC conditions, followed by an analysis of the surface morphology of the samples. Subsequently, the performance and durability of the nickel foams with different coatings are evaluated after being assembled in single fuel cells. The results highlight the superior corrosion resistance of graphite coating under HT-PEMFC conditions, demonstrating its performance over other coatings. Graphite-coated foams showed a significant reduction in corrosion current, approximately 58% lower than uncoated foams and 21% lower than the TiN coated foams. In practical applications, an HT-PEMFC single cell with graphite-coated nickel foam demonstrated a current density of 763 mA/cm2 at 0.6 V under conditions of 180 °C and 2 atm H2/air. The current density is 40% higher than that of the uncoated nickel foam. The results show notable long-term durability under constant current holding tests at 160 °C. The voltage decay rate in the graphite-coated cell was 48% lower compared to the cell with uncoated nickel forms."
