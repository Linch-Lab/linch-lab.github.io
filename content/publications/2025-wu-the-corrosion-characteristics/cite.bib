Abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of graphite coatings on nickel
   foam for use in high-temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells
   (HT-PEMFCs). Nickel foam, known for its high porosity and good
   conductivity, serves as an advantageous alternative to traditional flow
   channels but faces corrosion challenges in HT-PEMFCs, especially from
   phosphoric acid leakage. Graphite coatings are used as the protection
   layer and compared with nitride coatings. Chemical vapor deposition
   process parameters are first optimized for graphite growth. Corrosion
   polarization curves are then measured using a high-temperature
   phosphoric acid three-electrode system simulating HT-PEMFC conditions,
   followed by an analysis of the surface morphology of the samples.
   Subsequently, the performance and durability of the nickel foams with
   different coatings are evaluated after being assembled in single fuel
   cells. The results highlight the superior corrosion resistance of
   graphite coating under HT-PEMFC conditions, demonstrating its
   performance over other coatings. Graphite-coated foams showed a
   significant reduction in corrosion current, approximately 58\% lower
   than uncoated foams and 21\% lower than the TiN coated foams. In
   practical applications, an HT-PEMFC single cell with graphite-coated
   nickel foam demonstrated a current density of 763 mA/cm2 at 0.6 V under
   conditions of 180 degrees C and 2 atm H2/air. The current density is
   40\% higher than that of the uncoated nickel foam. The results show
   notable long-term durability under constant current holding tests at 160
   degrees C. The voltage decay rate in the graphite-coated cell was 48\%
   lower compared to the cell with uncoated nickel forms.},
