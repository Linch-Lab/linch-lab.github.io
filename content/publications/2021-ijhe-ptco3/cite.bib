Abstract = {This study demonstrates the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane
   fuel cell (PEMFC) can be significantly enhanced with laser deposited and
   processed PtCo3 nanoporous film as the catalyst layer. The PtCo3
   nanoporous film is fabricated by first depositing a thin film of stacked
   PtCo3 nanoparticles on gas diffusion layer using pulsed laser deposition
   and then subjecting the film to scanning continuous-wave laser
   processing. The heating by the scanning laser beam increases
   electrochemical surface area substantially, which could be ascribed to
   formation of Pt skin on each nanoparticle via Pt surface segregation.
   Furthermore, the durability of the catalyst under accelerated
   degradation test is greatly enhanced, which may be attributed to
   inhibition of Co leaching by the Pt skin and strengthening of the
   contacts between nanoparticles caused by concomitant sintering effect.
   Application of such catalyst to the cathode of a PEMFC exhibits a
   2.4-fold increase in current density with respect to that without laser
   processing, raising the cathode massspecific power density to 8.79 kW
   g(-1) with 1 atm oxygen and 12.0 kW g(-1) with 1.5 atm oxygen. (C) 2021
