  This study demonstrates the performance of polymer electrolyte membrane fuel
  cell (PEMFC) can be significantly enhanced with laser deposited and processed
  PtCo3 nanoporous film as the catalyst layer. The PtCo3 nanoporous film is
  fabricated by first depositing a thin film of stacked PtCo3 nanoparticles on
  gas diffusion layer using pulsed laser deposition and then subjecting the film
  to scanning continuous-wave laser processing. The heating by the scanning
  laser beam increases electrochemical surface area substantially, which could
  be ascribed to formation of Pt skin on each nanoparticle via Pt surface
  segregation. Furthermore, the durability of the catalyst under accelerated
  degradation test is greatly enhanced, which may be attributed to inhibition of
  Co leaching by the Pt skin and strengthening of the contacts between
  nanoparticles caused by concomitant sintering effect. Application of such
  catalyst to the cathode of a PEMFC exhibits a 2.4-fold increase in current
  density with respect to that without laser processing, raising the cathode
  mass-specific power density to 8.79 kW g−1 with 1 atm oxygen and 12.0 kW g−1
  with 1.5 atm oxygen.
summary: One-line takeaway for readers skimming listings.
