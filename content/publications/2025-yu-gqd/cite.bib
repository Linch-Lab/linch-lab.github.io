Abstract = {The use of graphene quantum dot (GQD)-modified CoFe layered double
   hydroxides (GQD@CoFe-LDH), grown on nickel foam, is explored as an anode
   catalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in anion exchange
   membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs). Careful tuning of GQD loading
   reveals that an optimal amount of GQDs induces a pronounced synergistic
   effect, enhancing electron transport and active site utilization while
   lowering the overpotential for the OER. Compared with pristine CoFe-LDH,
   GQD incorporation significantly reduces interfacial charge-transfer
   resistance, thereby enhancing OER activity. In single-cell AEMWE
   testing, the GQD@CoFe-LDH anode with optimal GQD loading achieves a
   current density of 1749 mA cm-2 at 2.0 V, indicating a marked
   improvement over the unmodified CoFe-LDH. This enhancement corresponds
   to a 61\% increase in OER performance relative to the pristine
   electrode. These findings underscore the effectiveness of rational GQD
   modification in improving both catalytic activity and corrosion
   resistance of CoFe-LDH electrodes, presenting a promising and
   cost-efficient strategy for hydrogen production via water electrolysis.},
