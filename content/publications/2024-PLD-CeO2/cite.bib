Abstract = {Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells employing a Pt catalyst
   layer composed of stacked Pt nanoparticles deposited by pulsed laser
   deposition (PLD) has the advantage of high Pt utilization and large
   surface-tovolume ratio so as to render a high mass-specific power
   density. However, the current density and cell durability are limited by
   the restricted gas permeability in the catalyst layer and
   electrochemical Ostwald ripening respectively. Here we demonstrate that
   by adding a nanoporous CeO2 overlayer produced with PLD together with
   drop-casted Nafion dried under optimized temperature and relative
   humidity, the current density and durability of the cell can be enhanced
   substantially relative to that without CeO2 layer and using a commercial
   PEM, presumably through controlling Nafion distribution in the pores of
   the Pt layer. This method is expected to be also applicable to all
   PEMFCs based on nanostructured thin-film catalyst with catalyst support.},
