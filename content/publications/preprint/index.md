abstract: The rising global demand for energy and the climate crisis caused by
  fossil fuel combustion require an immediate shift toward renewable energy
  sources. Seawater electrolysis offers a sustainable method for producing green
  hydrogen by utilizing abundant ocean resources in direct conjunction with
  renewable power inputs. Green hydrogen has surfaced as a key energy carrier
  with minimal intermittent losses in transport and power generation.
  Nevertheless, the ionic composition of seawater affects efficiency,
  electrocatalyst stability, and operational costs. Specifically, the chloride
  oxidation reaction occurring at the anode presents a serious risk to the
  integrity of electrodes and the long-term functionality of devices. This
  review encapsulates the essential mechanisms of seawater electrolysis, the
  criteria for assessing electrocatalyst performance in renewable energy
  systems, and the unique challenges associated with noble-metal-based
  electrodes. Recent progress in noble-metal-free composite electrocatalysts
  through techniques such as heterostructure engineering, metal doping,
  protective coatings, and anion intercalation, all of which collectively
  increase resistance to chloro-oxidation and increase durability, has also been
  emphasized. By bringing together these advancements, this review offers a
  technological framework for incorporating seawater electrolysis into renewable
  energy infrastructure, facilitating efficient hydrogen production in
  challenging marine environments, ensuring reliable energy storage, and
  furthering the global effort toward a carbon-neutral future.
